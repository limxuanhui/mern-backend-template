# mern-backend-template

This repository is a code template for the backend stack of MERN, built with MongoDB Atlas, Express.js and Node.js.
It includes a simple authentication and authorization feature for the User model created with Mongoose Schema.
This repository serves as a good starting point for backend development using MERN and hopes to save some time for web developers.
